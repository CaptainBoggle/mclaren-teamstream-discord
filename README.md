# mclaren-teamstream-discord
Python script to automatically post content from the McLaren F1 teamstream to a discord server via webhooks. Made during the Suzuka 2022 red flag.

the program requires two arguments, first an event code (R, Q, P1, P2 or P3) and second the mode of display (console or discord). if using discord, you will need to supply a webhook URL in main.py.
# Example
./main.py R discord
